    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French fries, also known as chips or frites in some regions, are a popular snack and side dish consisting of deep-fried potatoes cut into thin strips. 
    They are typically seasoned with salt and can be served with various condiments like ketchup, mayonnaise, or vinegar. French fries can be enjoyed on their own or as a side with meals like hamburgers and fish. 
    While the exact origin is debated, some sources point to Belgium as a likely birthplace in the late 17th century, where villagers fried potatoes as a substitute for fish during winter. Others credit French street vendors with popularizing the dish in the late 18th and 19th centuries. </p>
