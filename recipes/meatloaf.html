    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Meatloaf is a savory dish made from ground meat—often beef, pork, or a combination—mixed with breadcrumbs, eggs, and seasonings, then shaped into a loaf and baked. It’s a hearty comfort food, often served sliced with gravy, ketchup, or other sauces.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    

    <ul>
        <h3>Meatloaf</h3>
        <li>1 large egg </li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning </li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1.5 lbs. ground beef (80/20)</li>
        <h3>Glaze</h3>
        <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp yellow mustard</li>
    </ul>    

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF. In a small bowl whisk together the egg, milk, and Worcestershire sauce. In a separate small bowl, stir together the breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mince the onion.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef, egg mixture, breadcrumb mixture, and minced onion to a large bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until evenly combined. Avoid over mixing.</li>
        <li>Place the meatloaf mixture on a rimmed baking dish and shape it into a loaf that is approximately 4-inches wide, 8-inches long, and 2-inches tall.</li>
        <li>In a separate small bowl, stir together the glaze ingredients (ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard). Spread the glaze evenly over the top and sides of the meatloaf.</li>
        <li>Bake the meatloaf for 50-55 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. Allow the meatloaf to rest for 5-10 minutes after baking, then slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
