# odin-recipes
TOP lesson

odin recipes is going to be a recipie website. I will build it to include links and images to/of all the different recipies and properly emphasise everything with bolds or italics. Although the website will not be pretty i will update it in time with better visuals. In short: "I want a usable recipe index working in a browser with clickable links"
